## Week 7 Homework Readme Document
Jacqueline Evans-Shaw

# Overview

This week's assignmen again had me pretty stumped! I wasn't able to get my code where it needed to be, despite haivng received some help from multiple people, nothing seemed to work quite as I needed it to. However, I decided to turn in the code I produced anyway, to show that I did at least put in the effort of trying to work out the assignment, and maybe to figure out what went wrong. If I had had more time, I would have worked longer on it; in the future I'm going to also utilize the Issues Forum to get a few other perspectives on the project! Thank you.
