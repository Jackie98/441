## Week 2 Homework Readme Rundown

# This Week's Homework
---
This week's assignment was very straightforward and easy to follow! To complete this homework, I did the following:
1. Watched along with the video;
2. Checked with the tutorials to make sure my code was correct;
3. Also checked with a peer to see if I had missed or misunderstood anything.

I understood the material relatively well, because I recalled it from past coding and web design classes I've taken in the past.

In all honesty, I very much enjoyed how simple this assignment was, and found the directions to be easier to follow than other coding/web design classes I've taken. Thanks so much for reading!
