Work Cycle

For this week's homework, I reached out for help from several of my classmates. I received the most help from my friend Kaitlin. We were able to collaborate and walk each other through the steps of the assignment while we worked long-distance. While she was able to get hers working mostly the way she wanted, I only succeeded halfway in completing mine the way I intended! I didn't want to completely replicate what she had done, but after struggling with it for some time (and already being late to turning it in), I decided I better move on.

Successes

Well, at the very least I was able to make one of my squares move. I liked the abrupt and repetitive motion of it so I chose to leave it as it is.

As I mentioned earlier, I wasn't quite able to get my second square to move on its own nor could I figure out why my WASD code wasn't working. This frustrated me a lot, and I tried to work around it through several methods, but it didn't want to cooperate! So, I had to also leave that alone.
I'm also aware I'm turning this project in a day late, and I apologize for that! I got a late start on it this past week and realize that was totally on me. I'll do my best not to let that happen in the future.

Thanks for reading!
