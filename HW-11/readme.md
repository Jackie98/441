# Work Cycle

This week I got A LOT of extra help from my classmates and friends on this project, but honestly I'm pretty excited with how it turned out!
I wanted to make something fun for the final homework assignment, and this is the product!
The concept is to have the player "escape" the box before the design visually blocks them in. It works fairly well as I intended, but sometimes you can get stuck on th perimeter of the invisible box and the colors in the background glitch and the player's square disappear, so I'm not sure what's going on with that. But overall it's rather straightforward and has interesting visual designs/effects!

Successes
---
I was finally able to understand how to move an object with WASD like we worked on last week! Also a friend of mine explained to me how to code in a background that was constantly changing colors, so that was very neat to implement. I also was able to code for collisions, which I don't think I did so well last week.

Issues
---
Like I mentioned before, there is some glitching and "dragging" of the square sometimes, where it gets struck and almost seems to smear itself across the canvas, which I wasn't actually aware of until today when I was finalizing its test runs. Other than that, it works in a simple manner, and I'm just happy I could make something better than last week!
