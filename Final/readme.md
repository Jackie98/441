# The Final Product :)
---

My goal with this project was rather ambitious for my coding skillset. I intended to make a memory-matching game where the player would hover over the cards and music would play, prompting the player to then match the song to the lyrics.
I initially struggled with this, because I wanted to revamp our original matching game from Homework 5. I was able to do this with the addition of a 3D flipping effect, which I very much liked. After completing that, I struggled with how I wanted to prompt audio when the card flipped. This proved to be more difficult and time-consuming than I expected, so instead I coded an audio player to cue the sound byte when it was played. In the end, I accomplished my task of playing music with the cards, even if it was with a different method.

I only wish I had spent more time to construct more cards and tunes, and maybe tweak the design of the game to make it more visually appealing, but overall I'm satisfied with how it turned out after struggling through it. In all honesty, I challenged myself quite a bit with this, but also learned what I do and still don't know about coding, and also how satisfying it is to make a complete and functional project.

Thank you so much for an enriching semester!
