## Week 8 Homework Readme Document
Jacqueline Evans-Shaw

# Work Process
---
For this particular assignment, I worked with a few other classmates to navigate the example code and exchange ideas. I found this especially helpful, and learned a lot along the way!

# Successs
---
I was excited and mostly satisfied with my final product, as I was successful in animating my shapes as well as changing my images! I feel like this was the first cohesive piece I've produced in a week or so, and that was very pleasing.

# Issues
---
I was unsure how to animate text, so I left it out because I became too hung up on it. I also was not sure how to stop my images from repeating back to back, but since it was a random method, I don't think I had much control over that or that it mattered.
I know my project isn't very visually exciting, but I'm just glad I was able to figure out the major points and produce something to play with! Thanks so much for your help and insight, Prof.
