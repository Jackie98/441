## Week 3 Readme document

# Work Process
---
This week, I spent a little longer working on the assignment than I did in the two past weeks. This was because I was initially slightly lost, which I expect I will be as I gradually continue to learn the ins-and-outs of Javascript.

However, after working through the tutorials, experimenting with Code Academy, and sharing insights with friends, I believe I was able to complete the beginnings of an adventure (to the extent of my limited knowledge!) It took a lot of tinkering and re-drafting the code, but I feel satisfied so far with what I was able to produce.

# Issues
---
One issue I ran into was "presenting" an option for the reader. I was unclear whether this was achieved through a "function", or another method that I had overlooked. I decided to design it using the function method, with the assumption that this area will be readdressed and explained further next week.

I also was temporarily confused as to why I could not break my "document.write" text into paragraphs without the text being highlighted in red. This problem seemed to solve itself as I continued writing on the same line (though I don't like the look of the seeming run-on sentence that was produced! I suppose that's just how the cookie crumbles, though.)

I didn't have any further major issues; I hope what I produced for this week was satisfactory, and if there is anything I missed or fudged on, I would appreciate and benefit from any feedback! Thanks for reading!
