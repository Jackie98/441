# Work Process
---
This week's assignment had me struggling a bit. I was able to assemble my first information page and connect it to the game page, however after that, I think I became lost in the JSON information, and I wasn't able to completely print out the results onto a final page. I worked a bit with the prof and a classmate as well (who was equally stumped), but in the end, I had to cut my work process short because I realized I wasn't understanding enough to successfully finish the assignment.

# Successes
---
On the one hand, I was able to connect my beginning page that gathered the player's information to my game page, which I was proud of. I was also able to add more content to my game (with a little bit of help!)

# Issues
---
On the other hand, I wasn't able to fully print my game's results on my final page, although I did spend quite a bit of time trying out different things with my Page 1 and Page 2 with the help of the Prof. I went back and re-watched and re-read the tutorials, but nothing seemed to work, so I unfortunately had to call it a day and move on. I'd greatly appreciate any feedback detailing what went wrong with my code, and how I can improve it in the future. Thanks for reading!
