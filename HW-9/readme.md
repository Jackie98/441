## Week 9-10 Homework Readme Document
Jacqueline Evans-Shaw

# Work Cycle
---
I spent a LOT of time trying to collab and troubleshoot with several other students and friends on this project. We discussed our difficulties and solutions, and even though it's far from perfect, I was able to produce a passable result in the end.

# Successes
---
I was at least able to produce information when it is called by the methods. In doing this I was able to connect all pages so the information would be produced in Ajax, jQuery and Json.

# Difficulties
---
Unfortunately, I didn't leave myself enough time to properly style my pages so they were presented as more visually appealing. I also was not sure how to expand on the display of the information in a satisfying way, so I kept with the simple presentation that was originally offered in the example.
With this coming week's assignment, I hope to give myself more time and creativity to complete the work to my liking. Thanks for reading!
