## Week 4 Readme document

# Work Process
---
This week's assignmed threw me for a loop! I followed along particularly closely to the demonstration videos and the coding example. Although I struggled with it in the beginning, I learned a LOT in the process and with the help that was given to me. My process consisted of a lot of experimenting,and going back and re-doing much of what I had written and correcting my errors.
I spent most of my time with the technicalities of using the DOM to change the page throughout the adventure. After I better understood this, the rest was relatively simple to execute!
# Issues
---
The most pressing issues I faced were centered on a "string literal" error and my getChoice1() being undefined. Several other students I talked to experienced the same issues, but were unsure how to help. After Cassens' help, my code was cleaned up, and the errors disappeared! (Thanks again!)
Another issue I encountered was getting my image to change...after several attempts I had to move on, but I would greatly appreciate feedback on where I went wrong with this (I was sure I followed the video correctly, but I still couldn't get it to change).
Finally, I wanted to add more paths to my game, but I think I confused myself with the choices and my else/if statements. If I had more time (lame excuse, but I've learned that hurrying myself doesn't help), I would have been able to explore more options and paths. I'm hoping to do so next time if we get the opportunity. This was a fun, challening, and enriching project! Thanks for reading!
